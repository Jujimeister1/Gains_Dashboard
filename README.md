# Background

As a casual lifter, I will be going into the background and how I structure my programming below. To improve my strength and lifts I began analyzing my own data a few months into my weightlifting journey. There's a concept in weightlifting called progressive overload which is when you gradually increase the weight, frequency, or number of repetitions in your strength training routine. Below is the overall goal and question I am trying to accomplish finding answers for. The metrics I've been tracking for weightlifting are reps, sets, volume, weight, and estimated one repetition max. The overall goal of this project is to display my performance results and statistics over a year and half period.
